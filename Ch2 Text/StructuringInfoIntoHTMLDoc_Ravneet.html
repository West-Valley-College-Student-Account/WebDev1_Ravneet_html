    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
    <p>
      This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the
      page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.
    </p>

    <!-- add a long line here -->

    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>
      Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure
      of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or
      lower-level headings).
    </p>
    <p>What should this be?</p>

    <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>
      Here you can see another sub-heading. But should this be a heading?
      Probably not. Too much info/text now. <br />
      right?
    </p>

    <!-- add a few "breaks" here to create some space! **hint** you can also use these to break 
     sentences into new lines... as it was intended to be used! try using one in the middle of 
     a paragraph and see what happens in your browser-->

    <br />
    <br />

    <h2>And Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>
      More headings?? Here you can see another sub-heading. You know what to do
      now. Let's use a proper tag.
    </p>

    <h2>Yet Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>
      That's a lot of headings. Here you can see another sub-heading. You know
      what to do now. Make this <strong>WORD</strong> strong aka <b>bold</b>.
      Give it a proper tag!
    </p>

    <!-- add the proper tags to change "th" and "2" below -->

    <p>
      Today is the 4<sup>th</sup> of July and there is a lot of CO<sub>2</sub>
      in the air. 

      <!-- try using the "abbr" tag just like it's used in the book for the line below --> 

      <p>In case you were wondering, here is <abbr title="Professor"></abbr>Prof John Doe's address!

        <!-- Make each line for the address appears on a new line, starting with the name -->

        <address>John Doe <br>14000 Fruitvale Ave<br>Saratoga, CA 95070 </address>
